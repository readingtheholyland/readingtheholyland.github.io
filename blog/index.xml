      <description>As the RTHL team goes through catalogues in search of Latin works about the Holy Land written during the crusades, one often comes across interesting things. During the crusades, pilgrimage guides devoted to the Holy Land were a very popular genre. They were often written by travelers who occasionally reused material from earlier accounts. One such text is found in a thirteenth-century manuscript preserved at the British Library in London (MS Harley 2333).</description>

      <description>Rorgo Fretellus&#39; description of the holy sites in and around Jerusalem - the Descriptio de locis sanctis - was one of the most popular Latin accounts of the Holy Land written during the crusades. First composed in the late 1130s, there remain over a hundred manuscripts that attest to its popularty and wide diffusion. Yet in spite of this wealth of manuscript witnesses, many things about this text and its author are still unknown to historians and a modern scholarly edition of it and its variants/redactions is lacking.</description>
