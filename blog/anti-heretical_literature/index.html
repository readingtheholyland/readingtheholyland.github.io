	  <h1>Medieval Heresies and Holy Land Descriptions</h1>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few weeks ago, I was working on Paris, BnF Lat 5129, one of the manuscript witnesses of Rorgo Fretellus’ <em>Descriptio de locis sanctis</em>. I soon realised that the transcription I had made months ago must be wrong: the explicit did not seem to match any of the known versions of Fretellus I had read so far. Since the images of this manuscript are available online, I went to the end of the text (f. 71r) and discovered that the explicit I copied was in fact a different text altogether. In the same folio where Fretellus’ account ends, there follows, in the second column, the following short text:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/images/paris_bnf_5129_f_71rb.png" alt="Paris, BnF MS 5129, f. 71rb"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Porro sanctus Dauid de criminibus mortiferis egit penitentiam quod tamen in honore permansit. Beatus quoque Petrus amarissimas lacrimas fudit quando se dominum negasse poeniuit sed tamen apostolus permansit. Et dominus per prophetam peccantibus pollicetur dicens ‘peccator quacumque hora conuersus ingemuerit peccatum suum, omnium iniquitatum illius non recordabor.’ Errant ergo qui putant sacerdotes post lapsum si dignam egerint poenitentiam domino ministrare non posse et suis honoribus serui si bonam deinceps uitam duxerint.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which could be roughly translated as:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Saint David did penance for his murderous crimes, and so remained in honour. Blessed Peter also shed bitter tears when he repented of denying the Lord, and yet remained an apostle. And the Lord promises sinners through the prophet, saying: ‘At whichever hour the sinner repents and groans over his sin, I will not remember his iniquities.’ They are wrong therefore those who think that priests after a fall [or ‘the Fall’?] cannot serve the Lord if they have done a worthy penance, and that they cannot serve with their honours if they have led a good life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This text represents a short statement against the Donatist position, namely the belief that Christian clergy should lead a faultless life for their ministry to be effective and their prayers and sacraments to be valid. This heresy, which emerged in the fourth century in the region of the Church of Carthage subsided after the sixth century, but its core beliefs, including that of the absolute necessity of holiness for priest, were revived by the Cathars in twelfth-century Europe. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Indeed, the origin of our manuscript would support the idea that it was written at a time of strong conflict with the Cathars. According to Pringle, it was produced at the Abbey of Saint-Amand-les-Eaux in between 1151-53. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The Cathar heresy was then quickly spreading throughout this region of north-Eastern France and it would not be surprising that the Benedictine monks at Saint-Amand were reading, and writing down, texts that would help fight the Cathars.</p>

<p>The presence of this text at the end of Fretellus’ <em>Descriptio</em>, however, raises the following question: how were these two works related to each other? Could descriptions of holy sites also serve in this period to fight against Cathars beliefs that denied the incarnation of Christ by presenting with their detail accounts of the life of Christ, the Holy Sites, the geography of the Levant, and the material remains of the passion and resurrection&hellip; are all an attempt to counteract Cathars' denial of Christ incarnation.?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If we have a wider look at the contents of the manuscript, two other texts stand out: an anonymous poem on the creation of the world, and a poem attributed to Hildebert (c. 1055 – 1133), bishop of the nearby city of Le Mans.</p>
