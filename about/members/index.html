<p>Jonathan Rubin teaches at the Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at Bar Ilan
University, Israel. His work focuses on two main themes: the intellectual history of the Crusader
Kingdom of Jerusalem and travel literature. Among his publications are: “The Manuscript
Tradition of Burchard of Mount Sion’s Descriptio Terre Sancte,” <em>The Journal of Medieval Latin</em> 30
(2020), pp. 257-286; “Spiritual and Practical Instructions for Pilgrims: A Preliminary Presentation
of Two Unknown Texts,” <em>Mediterranean Historical Review</em> 35.2 (2020), pp. 211-218; and
<em>Learning in a Crusader City: Intellectual Activity and Intercultural Exchanges in Acre, 1191–1291</em>
(Cambridge, 2018).</p>

<h2 id="jose-maria-andres-porras">Jose Maria Andres Porras</h2>
<p><img src="/images/jose.jpg" alt="Jose Maria Andres Porras"></p>
<p>Jose Maria Andres Porras is a third-year DPhil student in History at Oxford who has previously
completed a BA in History and Political Science and a MA in History at the University of Haifa,
Israel. His doctoral research, funded by the AHRC and St Hugh’s College, examines attitudes
towards biological descent in late medieval Tuscany with a special focus on the interaction between
intellectual ideas and social practice. He is interested in late medieval intellectual and social history,
the history of medicine, and has always had a great passion for manuscript studies, codicology, and
palaeography which he deepened at the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, the Medici Archive
Project in Florence, and the Beinecke Library at Yale. He works as research assistant in the ‘Reading
the Holy Land’ project and has been focusing on the creation of the database with the manuscripts
of our corpus.</p>

<h2 id="rahel-salquin">Rahel Salquin</h2>
<p><img src="/images/rahel.jpg" alt="Rahel Salquin"></p>
<p>My name is Rahel Salquin, I grew up in Switzerland, and after having passed my final
high school exams I emigrated to Israel. After having spent some time in different parts
of the country, I decided to stay and live in Jerusalem.
From 1992-1994 I studied to become a licensed tour guide, and until March 2020 I
guided many thousands of tourists through all parts of Israel.
The year 2020 brought a big change, as I decided to fulfill a dream of many years and
study Archeology. Currently I am an undergraduate student at the “Department of Land
of Israel Studies and Archeology” of the Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, and I am
very happy to be taking part in the project “Reading the Holy Land”.</p>
