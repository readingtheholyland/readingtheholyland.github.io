palaeography which he deepened at the National Library of Israel in Jerusalem, the Medici Archive
Project in Florence, and the Beinecke Library at Yale. He works as research assistant in the ‘Reading
the Holy Land’ project and has been focusing on the creation of the database with the manuscripts
of our corpus, the edition of some minor works of it, and the study of texts from the corpus.</p>
